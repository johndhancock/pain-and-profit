    <p>Over the next few years, four other doctors also said he needed the $13,000 machine, which pumps vapor medicine to clear out his lungs and prevent deadly infections. The state health commission agreed, ordering the company it hired to care for him to cover the cost of the <span class="highlight">equipment</span> he has used every day since he left the hospital.</p>
    <p>But the company ignored that order and refused to pay, again and again, according to his medical records. The company denied him other equipment, too.

      <p>How a company’s refusal to cover medical costs is hurting sick foster kids in Texas. <a href="part6.html">Catch up.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>“I didn’t understand,” said Farquer, now 22. “I need this equipment to keep me alive and healthy.</p>

    <p>“Why would you put my life on the line to save money?”</p>

    <p>When health care companies hired by the state refuse to cover doctor-ordered medical treatments, patients and their families are supposed to be able to fight back through a so-called “fair hearing.”</p>

    <p>In these proceedings, employees of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission weigh testimony from the patient and from the company, typically by phone. Experts say this system is crucial to making sure companies that manage the Medicaid health-care system aren’t boosting their profits by refusing to pay for treatments patients really need.</p>

    <p>But in Texas, the system is stacked against patients, a <em>Dallas Morning News</em> investigation found.</p>

    <p>Using state records and data, we reviewed the outcomes of 16,000 fair hearings over more than eight years and found: </p>

    <ul class="content__list">
      <li>In more than two-thirds of the cases, the health-care companies prevailed over patients and their doctors. The process in Texas is so arduous that half the patients give up before they get a ruling.</li>
      <li>Fair-hearing rulings don’t set precedent, allowing companies to deny the same service again just months later and forcing patients to appeal over and over. The state has made no attempt to track how often sick and vulnerable Texans get stuck on the fair hearing carousel.</li>
      <li>Patients can’t even invoke prior rulings that could help their cases because Texas keeps them hidden. Texas is among only a handful of states that don’t make fair-hearing rulings readily available to the public.</li>
      <li>When patients do win, there is no enforcement mechanism to make companies pay up. In Farquer’s case, hearing officers twice ordered his managed-care provider to pay for medical equipment he needed, but the company simply didn’t.</li>
      <li>Fair hearings often concern critical long-term treatments, which are also the most costly services. Of the cases involving chronically sick and disabled children, for example, at least a third were for expensive in-home nursing and therapy services.</li>
  </ul>

    <p>After <em>The News</em> raised questions about the fairness of the process, Texas health officials said they would look at fair-hearing and complaint data “to identify concerning trends not only for service denials but also other <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part3.html">issues related to access to care</a>.” </p>
    <p>State officials also say they are working to improve the information patients get about why companies are denying the treatments and how to appeal those decisions. </p>

    {% include 'adblock1.html' %}

    <p>Texas pays more than $20 billion a year to private companies to manage health benefits for more than 4 million Texans, most of them poor children. But the program also covers 30,000 <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part6.html">foster kids</a>, about 160,000 <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part5.html">severely sick children</a> and more than 500,000 elderly and disabled adults. </p>
    <p>While the program has a good track record of providing preventive care like vaccinations for healthy kids, <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part2.html">it has often failed to meet the needs of sick Texans</a> as lawmakers expanded “managed care” to include chronically ill and disabled people. The companies receive a set payment per patient, so the less care they provide, the more taxpayer money they can keep. </p>
    <p>The companies didn’t create Texas’ byzantine appeals system — but they definitely benefit from it. </p>

    {% include 'partials/part7-appeals.html' %}

    <p>Here’s how: Suppose a doctor prescribes an expensive treatment and asks the patient’s managed-care company to pay for it. The company refuses.</p>

    <p>The state requires patients to appeal directly to the company first. Weeks later, the company upholds its denial, which is common. The patient then files for a fair hearing, which can take months, and gathers medical records and doctors’ notes to build a case.</p>

    <p>If a patient is lucky, he or she is able to get a lawyer to help (though that’s rare). Finally, the patient calls the state hearing officer and presents a case; the company responds. The companies almost always win, so they seldom have to pay.</p>

    <p>But suppose, against the odds, the patient prevails.</p>

    <p>A few months later, the company denies the exact same treatment again. The whole process starts over. </p>

    <p>“Their thinking is, ‘Well, we didn’t like that decision, so we’ll just try again,’” said Peter Hofer, a veteran disability lawyer who has represented clients in more than 200 of these proceedings.</p>

    <p>“I have a case right now where we won a fair hearing in February, and then it was denied in May.” </p>

    <p>Superior HealthPlan, the managed-care organization that repeatedly refused to cover Farquer’s special breathing device, said it follows state and federal rules and does not use the fair-hearing process as a way to reduce its costs. The company noted that Farquer never went without the equipment his doctors prescribed, though Superior fought against paying for it.</p>

    <p>A company spokeswoman, Debra Danziger, <a href="document.html?number=4901254&title=Superior-Fairhearings-Statement.html">said</a> the number of patients who appeal to the state is a small fraction of the millions of Texans who receive care. About 86 percent of fair hearing appeals end in favor of companies, she said, which proves they are doing a good job of denying only unnecessary care.</p>

    <p>But dozens of patients, parents and lawyers who’ve faced off against these companies say those stats show the system fails patients and protects companies.</p>

    <p class="cutline">Jessica Lukefahr, now 31, makes a mug of tea with the help of a standing wheelchair. Lukefahr was denied that equipment in 2013 and eventually took her case all the way to Texas’ 3rd Court of Appeals, winning in late 2016. Disability lawyers and advocates say her case exposed systemic flaws in the state’s appeals system.</p>
  </div>

 <section class="content-well">

    <p class="subhead">‘Arbitrary and capricious’</p>

    <p><span class="sectioncap">T</span>hough each state runs its own fair-hearing process, the system was created by the federal government so that Americans who are denied government services could fight back without going to court.</p>

    <p>By design, few cases get reviewed by real judges. But legal experts say one recent court ruling highlighted significant inequities in the state’s fair-hearing system.</p>

    <p>Jessica Lukefahr was born with cerebral palsy, and her atrophied muscles and compressed organs cause her constant, severe pain. </p>

    <p>In early 2013, when she was 26, her doctor prescribed a special wheelchair to lift her to a standing position to alleviate some of her suffering and allow her to keep working at the front desk of a small museum in Kingsville, southwest of Corpus Christi.</p>

    <p>When the state refused to cover the cost of the wheelchair, she filed for a fair hearing, saying that in her unusual situation the special equipment was medically necessary. In March 2014, she testified along with her lawyer and a physical therapist and provided articles from a medical journal that showed how patients like her benefit from standing wheelchairs.</p>

    <p>Two months later, a hearing officer ruled against her, arguing that she could use a cheaper device that would allow her to stand, but only in the same spot in her apartment. </p>

    <p>Lukefahr then took the unusual step of requesting that lawyers for the state health commission take another look at her case.</p>

    <p>Her chances of victory were slim. When <em>The News</em> reviewed the last four years of such requests, we found that only 19 out of 386, or 5 percent, ended in the patients’ favor.</p>

    <div class="inline-block image-block">
      {{img.jpg('lukefahr-secondary', 'Jessica Lukefahr poses for a photo in her powered wheelchair with standing function at her Section 8 apartment in Kingsville, Texas, Monday, February 5, 2018.', sizes='(min-width: 740px) 650px, 95vw')}}
      <p class="cutline">Jessica Lukefahr poses for a photo in her apartment in Kingsville, southwest of Corpus Christi.</p>

    <p> Sure enough, the state lawyers also ruled against her.</p>
    <p>That’s when Lukefahr took an even more unusual step — she filed a lawsuit and asked a court in Travis County to review her case. <a href="document.html?number=4334695&title=Texas-Health-and-Human-Services-Commission-v.html#document/p2/a394639">The judge found</a> that the fair-hearing ruling was “arbitrary and capricious,” a decision that wasn’t backed up by evidence.</p>
    <p>The health commission took the case to Texas’ 3rd Court of Appeals in June 2015.</p>
    <p>The appeals court <a href="document.html?number=4901309&title=Texas-HHSC-v-Lukefahr-decision.html#document/p22/a454858">excoriated the state</a> for its arbitrary decision-making and shifting justifications. “There was no more than a scintilla of evidence to support HHSC’s decision,” the court said, “… and no rational connection between the decision and the facts.”</p>

    <p>Rather than providing a reasoned ruling, the court found, the hearing officer had simply listed a lot of facts that were “legally irrelevant.” Such lists are a common feature of fair-hearing decisions.</p>

    <p>“If you read the findings of fact in the decisions, you’d think she was going to win because there wasn’t anything adverse to her case,” said Lukefahr’s lawyer, Maureen O’Connell of the Southern Disability Law Center. </p>

    <p>“It demonstrated some serious problems with the fair-hearing process.”</p>

    <p>The court heard testimony from one state employee who said the supporting research Lukefahr submitted, from a peer-reviewed medical journal, wasn’t good enough. The health commission requires a <a href="document.html?number=4901309&title=Texas-HHSC-v-Lukefahr-decision.html#document/p21/a454864">“Level 1”</a> study, that health official said.</p>
    <p>That standard wasn’t in any of the state’s published rules and hadn’t been mentioned in the lower-court case. The state said it was an unpublished internal policy — which was not available to the public. </p>

    <p>It took Lukefahr, now 31, nearly four years to get the chair. Today she can do some basic cooking, she said, and more important things: “For the first time, I was able to hug my mom properly without falling down.”</p>

    <p class="subhead">A widespread problem </p>

    <p><span class='sectioncap'>T</span>he health commission said it was just one bad case, but disability lawyers argue that Lukefahr exposed fundamental flaws in the state’s hearing system and raised questions about the treatment of thousands of other vulnerable Texans who must endure the same process.</p>

    <p>Since 2015, Texas courts have received only 20 appeals from patients, commission records show. So until now, the vast majority of decisions have received zero scrutiny outside of the Texas health commission.</p>

      <p class="cutline">“The chips are stacked against the client from the very beginning,” says Terry Anstee, a lawyer at Disability Rights Texas who has represented patients in about 80 fair hearings.</p>
    </div>

    <p>We analyzed thousands of cases that didn’t make it to court and found the arbitrary decision-making that judges criticized in Lukefahr’s case is a systemwide problem. </p>
    <p><em>The News</em> analyzed hearing decisions by more than 70 hearing officers from 2010 to 2018 and found patients’ chances of winning depend a lot on which hearing officer they draw.</p>

    <p>If you’re lucky, you might draw Diana Ragsdale. She sided with patients 110 out of 128 times, or 86 percent of the time. </p>

    <p>If you’re unlucky, you might end up with Patricia Trevino-Garcia, one of the state’s lead hearing officers. She’s sided with patients in only 49 of the 254 cases she heard, or 19 percent of the time.</p>

    <p>Neither hearing officer responded to our requests for comment. But Christine Mann, a spokeswoman for the health commission, said Trevino-Garcia hears “more complex, high-profile and medically sensitive cases” and shouldn't be compared to Ragsdale.</p>

    <p>“The chips are stacked against the client from the very beginning,” said Terry Anstee, a lawyer with Disability Rights Texas who has represented patients in about 80 fair hearings.</p>

    <p>“Especially,” he added, “if you know that hearing officer rules for the managed-care organization on a regular basis.”</p>

    <p>Most patients and their families do not have lawyers when they go into fair hearings, he noted, so they’re outgunned when they face off against company executives. </p>

    <p>The state doesn’t track how often patients bring lawyers to these hearings, but <em>The News</em> reviewed paper records, the only way to find the attendees, from more than 1,000 fair hearings involving children. Only 6 percent of those patients had a lawyer.</p>

    <p>Mann said hearing officers are trained to guide patients through the appeals process.</p>

    <p>“These officers go to considerable lengths to allow them every opportunity to make their case without imposing technical requirements,” she said.</p>

    <p class="subhead">Texas among the worst</p>

    <p><span class="sectioncap">A</span>nother big reason patients are likely to lose is that fair-hearing officers aren’t doctors or lawyers. They are state employees whose charge is to determine whether the health care companies follow guidelines on what is medically necessary — rules that the companies write for themselves. </p>
    <p>Texas sets broad standards for medical necessity, but each of the 20 managed-care organizations interprets and applies those standards differently. The policies are constantly changing and are seldom available to the public.</p>
    <p>That’s a national problem, said Sarah Somers, a managing attorney at the National Health Law Program.</p>

    <p>She said Texas makes matters worse by not making hearing decisions easily accessible to the public, as most states do, despite a federal rule that says “the public must have access” to decisions.</p>
    <p>In New York, patients can go to the state's website and <a href="https://otda.ny.gov/hearings/search/">search nearly a decade</a> of hearing decisions. Several other states provide decisions to patients for free upon request.</p>

    <p>Here, patients must make a formal request for records under the Texas Public Information Act, a costly process that can take months. When <em>The News</em> asked for a year of decisions, the state said the documents would cost more than $3,000.</p>

    <p>“The public really doesn’t have access if you have to pay thousands of dollars and make a records request,” Somers said, adding that most people who rely on Medicaid are very poor.</p>

    <p>A state spokeswoman said that the commission was working toward posting decisions online but that removing personal information would take “considerable time.”</p>

    <p>Other states automatically review cases in which companies deny care, long before patients file for a fair hearing. In Delaware, state nurses examine each patient appeal; in Tennessee the state health agency assesses appeals that companies uphold.</p>
    <p>A <a href="document.html?number=4411710&title=GAO-CMS-Should-Improve-Oversight-of-Access-and.html#document/p28/a411082">report from federal watchdogs</a> found that those states overturned denials, siding with patients, about twice as often as in states that, like Texas, don’t double-check the companies’ decisions.</p>

    <p class="subhead">Targeting expensive care</p>

    <p><span class="sectioncap">L</span>ast year, Texas lawmakers gave companies billions of dollars’ worth in more business by turning over the care of about 160,000 <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part5.html">chronically sick and disabled children</a>, most of whom rely on expensive treatments and equipment. </p>

    <p>Immediately, complaints and appeals surged — and so did fair hearings. In 2017, the state heard more than 3,500 cases, a 35 percent increase from the year before. </p>

    <p>Two-thirds of those new cases were from parents of medically fragile children whose care had just been handed over to managed-care companies under the program called STAR Kids. </p>

    <p>More than a third of those parents withdrew before their hearings without getting anything, state data shows. And when a hearing did occur, the state hearing officer ruled against patients 76 percent of the time. </p>

    <p>One out of every three fair hearings filed by STAR Kids parents were about in-home nursing and therapy, which can cost managed-care organizations hundreds of dollars a day per child.</p>

    <p>In hearings involving the most expensive services, companies often send high-powered executives to argue against parents and patients. When that happens, the companies almost always win.</p>

    <p>Superior’s medical director, <a href="https://www.superiorhealthplan.com/newsroom/medical-director-spotlight-dr-william-brendle-glomb.html"></a>Dr. William Brendle Glomb</a>, appeared at 18 hearings in the appeals reviewed by <em>The News</em> — all of them about expensive nursing and equipment. In 17 of those, the hearing officer sided with Superior.</p>

    <p>Until Superior hired him in 2013, Glomb, a lung specialist, was medical director of the state health commission. He did not respond to requests for comment.</p>

    <p>“Our track record demonstrates our commitment to our members to provide all services that are medically necessary,” Superior’s spokeswoman <a href="document.html?number=4901254&title=Superior-Fairhearings-Statement.html">wrote in her lengthy statement</a>.</p>
    <p>In 2015, Glomb represented Superior against Farquer, the scooter accident victim whose doctors said he needed a special breathing machine called an intrapulmonary percussive ventilator, or IPV. Farquer’s medical records show Glomb said the paralyzed young man could use a cheaper option, a vest that vigorously shakes patients to loosen mucus in their airways.</p>
    <p>Superior’s spokeswoman told <em>The News</em> that it refused to pay for Farquer’s machine because that equipment isn’t covered by Medicare, an unrelated federal program for the elderly; nor is it typically covered by Medicaid for adults, she said. </p>

    <div class="image-block image--inset">
      {{img.jpg('farquer-grimace', 'Quadriplegic Zak Farquer, now 22, receives an IPV treatment by his licensed practical nurse Matthew Kipe (not pictured) at his father’s Killeen, Texas home, Saturday, September 30, 2017. ', sizes="(min-width: 800px) 500px, 90vw") }}
      <p class="cutline">Farquer receives a treatment from an intrapulmonary percussive ventilator, or IPV. This device, which his managed-care company repeatedly refused to cover, pulses vapor medicine into his airways to prevent choking and lung infections. </p>
    </div>

    <p>Two separate fair-hearing officers concluded that those arguments didn’t hold up under a state law that says Medicaid patients under age 21 must be given everything for which they have a medical need.</p>

    <p>And Farquer’s need was copiously documented; his team of doctors repeatedly told Superior that Farquer <a href="document.html?number=4953448&title=Farquer-1.html#document/p10/a457953">couldn't use a vest because his spine was fused with metal rods</a>. Shaking him could seriously hurt him. </p>

    <p><a href="document.html?number=4953448&title=Farquer-1.html#document/p4/a457952">In a March 2015 letter to a fair-hearing officer</a>, one of Farquer’s doctors accused Glomb of ignoring state guidelines about medical necessity.</p>

    <p>“Our conversation was fruitless,” Dr. Jorge Velazco wrote, because Glomb said he was going to deny the device “no matter what.”</p>

    <p>Through his hospital, Velazco declined to comment.</p>

    <p>Farquer ultimately won that appeal. </p>

    <p>Last year, Farquer dropped Superior and entered a different Medicaid managed-care program through United Healthcare. Since then, he said, he’s been able to get all the equipment and care he needs.</p>

    <p>He lives with his family in Killeen, sips Monster energy drinks through a straw, displays a lava lamp near his bed and boasts a collection of earrings from Hot Topic. Life is pretty good now, he said — as normal as he can expect. </p>

    <p>Asked what he would do if he had the power to fix the Medicaid managed-care system in Texas, Farquer offered a simple solution:</p>

    <p>“I’d put the people first,” he said. “I wouldn’t care about how much money I made. I wouldn’t put someone’s life on the line for money.”</p>

      <h5>How we did it</h5>

      <p>When we began investigating government health care in Texas, we focused on the <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part1.html">story of D’ashon Morris</a>, a brain-damaged baby in Mesquite whose foster mother had fought to get him round-the-clock nursing before his injury. She lost her battle in a convoluted appeals process that seemed stacked in favor of the managed-care companies. How often, we wondered, did that happen? How typical was her experience?</p>
      <p>We requested data using the Texas Public Information Act about the outcome of every “fair hearing” involving a managed-care company. The Texas Health and Human Services Commission provided eight years’ worth of hearing decisions, about 16,000 cases, which we analyzed several different ways.</p>
      <p>We used that data to compare hearing officers. We compared their rulings for similar types of cases and looked at outcomes among groups of officers with similar caseloads.</p>
      <p>We shared our findings with the commission, which did not dispute our conclusions, with one exception. It said we should not compare the individual track records of hearing officers, though it did not say our calculations of those records were wrong.</p>
      <p>The data included basic information about the outcome of the cases and the presiding hearing officer but lacked some key information. A small number of cases weren’t clearly labeled as belonging to a specific state program; those were excluded for our analysis of decisions in the STAR Kids program for very sick and disabled children.</p>
      <p>We also obtained and analyzed copies of thousands of decisions to track who attended these hearings. And we discovered that the vast majority of patients, like D’ashon, don’t have legal representation at appeals hearings.</p>
