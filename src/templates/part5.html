    <p class="intro"><span class="sectioncap">B</span>efore she had a baby so sick he couldn’t leave the hospital for his first year, Hannah Mehta never dreamed she would need help from a government health care program.</p>

<p>She and her husband had good corporate jobs, private health insurance and a big brick home in Flower Mound.</p>

<p>But Aiden, one of the triplets she had given birth to in 2007, had congenital defects and anomalies that mystified doctors. His organs weren’t in the right places, his lungs were collapsed, and he couldn’t breathe or eat on his own. He underwent several surgeries before his first birthday.</p>

    <div class="refer--inset">

      <p>Texas fails to act when health care companies put patients in peril. <a href="part4.html">Catch up.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>His parents were determined to care for him at home. But he needed a lot: nursing, oxygen, a feeding tube. Just one of his drugs costs $10,000 a month. And the family’s insurance didn’t cover nearly enough.</p>

<p>Mehta quit her job to care for Aiden, and by the time he was 2, the family had spent all their savings. On the advice of a friend, she signed up for a program, paid for with state and federal money, designed to keep chronically sick kids alive and protect their parents from financial ruin. Unlike other Medicaid programs in Texas, this one helps families even if they aren’t extremely poor.</p>

<p>But in 2016, Texas stopped running this Medicaid program directly and turned it over to the private sector under a system called managed care, which already covered foster kids and many elderly and disabled Texans. </p>

<p>Mehta and parents like her learned their doctors weren’t going to accept the new program — it paid them too little and added too much red tape. Families suddenly had to search out new pediatric lung and brain and spine specialists who were willing to participate. There weren’t many. </p>

<p>The parents were desperate to protect their kids. “There’s no Plan B for our families,” Mehta says. “There’s nowhere else for them to go, outside of placing them in an institution.”</p>

<p>State health officials said there was nothing they could do — any changes to the new program had to come from the Legislature. </p>

<p>So the parents banded together, forming a shoestring nonprofit called Protect TX Fragile Kids. And they headed to Austin. If Texas lawmakers saw their children — in wheelchairs and gurneys, tethered to machines — then maybe they would change their minds.</p>

<p>The parents had no idea what they were up against.</p>

    <p class="subhead">The revolving door</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">T</span>wo decades ago, Texas lawmakers sought cheaper, more efficient ways to provide medical care for poor kids and pregnant women. Some health care policy wonks said poor Texans would benefit from a system like the private sector’s HMOs — health maintenance organizations — to make sure they got basic care but not expensive, unnecessary treatments.</p>

<p>Under managed care, the state and federal governments pay a flat per-patient fee, which is meant to give health care companies an incentive to use the money wisely and provide better preventive care.</p>

<p>For one tiny and little known company, Centene Corp., Texas was the jet fuel it needed to build a national health care empire.</p>

<p>The Missouri company set up Superior HealthPlan to operate in Texas. And in 1998, it hired the head of the Texas health commission, Mike McKinney, as a vice president to help it get state business.</p>

    {% include 'partials/part5-revolving-door.html' %}

    <p>In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry hired his old friend McKinney as chief of staff. That year, Superior had about 55,600 patients in El Paso, Austin and San Antonio, according to Centene corporate filings. By the time Perry left office, Texas was paying the company to care for nearly a million people, in every county of the state.</p>

<p>McKinney would later leave Austin to run rapidly expanding Centene operations in several states.</p>

<p>Such spins through what critics call Texas’ “revolving door” have become common. </p>

<p>Five of the last seven Texas health commissioners left the state government and began working for managed-care companies as executives or lobbyists, state records show.</p>

<p>One former commissioner, Albert Hawkins, is vice chairman of the board of MCNA Insurance, which has a $600 million-a-year contract to provide state-funded dental insurance to poor Texans. The seventh commissioner, Charles Smith, retired May 31. </p>

    {% include 'partials/part5-lobbying-contribs.html' %}


<p>Counting McKinney, three people who served as Perry’s chief of staff became health care industry lobbyists. Two were close friends who had served with Perry in the Legislature in the 1980s, and they lobbied for health care companies before and after their time in the governor’s office.</p>

<p>Some industry lobbyists are now settling back into state jobs where they oversee the companies that previously paid them well.</p>

<p>Victoria Ford, a former senior adviser to Perry on health issues, lobbied for two major insurers and the Texas Association of Health Plans, a trade association controlled by managed-care companies. </p>

<p> She joined the health commission as its first “chief policy officer” in November, just 11 days after she told the state she was no longer lobbying for United Healthcare.</p>

<p>Some of Gov. Greg Abbott’s closest advisers also have ties to the managed-care industry.</p>

<p>Walter Fisher, Abbott’s legislative director, is a former lobbyist for Centene, which is now the biggest player in Medicaid managed care in the state — and the nation.</p>

<p>Abbott’s policy director is John Colyandro, who previously led the Texas Conservative Coalition, a group that accepts money from managed-care companies and publishes research in support of them.</p>

<p>In September, Abbott appointed a longtime United Healthcare lobbyist, Luis Saenz, as his chief of staff.</p>

<p>Abbott is <a href="document.html?number=4425431&title=Gov-Greg-Abbott-STAR-PLUS-Response.html#document/p3/a414124">a vocal defender</a> of managed-care Medicaid and has accepted $122,500 in campaign donations from these companies in the last five years.</p>

    {% include 'adblock1.html' %}

    <p class="subhead">Fragile Texans forced in</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">A</span>s the industry’s lobbying power grew, so did managed care.</p>

<p>A decade ago, Texas began moving foster children and disabled and elderly adults into managed care. Unlike the relatively healthy kids who make up most of the Medicaid population, these patients tend to need expensive long-term care such as home nursing and medical equipment like wheelchairs.</p>

<p>There were instant and pervasive problems, records show, including complaints that managed-care companies were withholding medically necessary but costly care — a practice that critics say is the only way companies can increase profits while serving these patients.</p>

<p>By 2013, almost 82 percent of Texans in Medicaid — 3 million people — were covered by managed care. That year, David Dewhurst, who was then lieutenant governor and controlled the Senate, called for rolling in a new group, kids so sick they are described as “medically fragile.”</p>

<p>Mehta’s state senator, Republican Jane Nelson, wrote the bill that would place Aiden and roughly 160,000 other children in the hands of private companies and a few nonprofits.</p>

<p>A year after that bill passed, Dewhurst’s longtime health policy adviser, Jamie Dudensing, became chief executive of the Texas Association of Health Plans, where she is a key defender of the program she helped create.</p>

    <div class="explainer explainer__term explainer--hidden">
      <h6><i class="fa fa-info-circle"></i> STAR Kids</h6>
      <p>The newest Medicaid managed care program for children and adults 20 and younger who have disabilities. This includes children who qualify for Social Security disability payments and the Medically Dependent Children Program, which helps families take care of severely sick kids even if they aren't poor.</p>
    </div>

    <p>As the launch of the program dubbed <span class="highlight">STAR Kids</span> neared in 2016, the president of Cook Children’s, a nonprofit managed-care provider in Fort Worth, warned health officials that the savings the state expected were “impossible to achieve” without taking medical services away from fragile kids.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Mehta and other parents in Protect TX Fragile Kids <a href="document.html?number=3460434&title=FINAL-Abbott-Ltr-080116-Attachments-Only.html">wrote letters to Abbott</a> and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, urging them to stop the rollout — but say they got no response.</p>

    {{img.jpg('hannah-meeting', 'Hannah Mehta speaks with former legislative director at the Office of Texas Governor Greg Abbott in a Capitol Extension Hallway. Hannah’s son, Aiden, waites patiently in his stroller.' )}}
    <p class="cutline">Hannah Mehta met in April of last year with Jay Dyer, then legislative director for Gov. Greg Abbott, to seek action to keep the state's shift to managed care from failing medically fragile children. Mehta’s son Aiden waited patiently in his stroller. Week after week during the 2017 legislative session, Mehta drove to the Capitol from her home in Flower Mound to talk with whoever would listen.</p>
  </div>

  <section class="content-well">

    <p class="subhead">Concerns ignored</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">I</span>n September 2016, after months of asking for a meeting, Mehta met with Nelson, the state senator she had repeatedly voted to re-elect. Now chairwoman of the Senate Finance Committee, Nelson served for many years as head of the committee on health care and was involved in just about every major piece of legislation that expanded managed care. </p>

<p>“We thought, ‘Surely she doesn’t understand what she’s done,’” Mehta says. “‘We’ll just go to her and talk to her about what this means for our kids.’”</p>

<p>Mehta brought a dozen other parents and two doctors, who told the senator that the companies Texas had hired were known for denying legitimate medical claims.</p>

<p>They asked her to use her weight as the Senate’s top budget writer to delay the program a year, so the state could study the consequences of entrusting severely sick children to managed-care companies.</p>

<p>“We based our decision on finance,” Nelson told the parents, according to a recording of the meeting.</p>

    <p>“While we're looking at doing things more efficiently, and cost-containment measures, I want to make sure that we're not doing things that would hurt someone,” she said.</p>

  <p>Days later, Mehta says, when she called Nelson’s office back to find out what was being done, the senator’s staff told her “nothing was going to be changed.”</p>

  <p>Nelson’s spokeswoman shared two letters the senator sent to the health commission, in <a href="document.html?number=4491818&title=Jane-Nelson-letter-PP-Day-5.html">September</a> and <a href="document.html?number=4491819&title=Jane-Nelson-letter-2-PP-Day-5.html#document/p1/a427332">October</a>, asking officials to update her office on the STAR KIDS rollout.</p>

  <p>"We care deeply about our children, and that is why we pushed the agency so hard to make accommodations during the transition,” Nelson said through her spokeswoman, Alexa Hoisager.</p>

  <p>In early October 2016, about a month before STAR Kids was to go live, an advisory board that included doctors, managed-care executives and parents of medically fragile children urged the health commission to suspend the rollout for a year to ensure kids got needed care. Part of their concern was that the tool the companies were going to use to determine each child’s medical needs hadn’t been fully tested. </p>

  <p>The health commission rejected the advice.</p>

  <p>So Mehta and other parents decided to take their fight to the Capitol, where the Legislature was convening in January 2017. </p>

  <p>Before the legislative session began, about 100 lawmakers accepted campaign contributions from managed-care companies, data shows. The companies also spent at least $5.4 million on lobbyists, more than in any previous year, according to filings with the Texas Ethics Commission.</p>

    <p class="subhead">A wave of complaints</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">I</span>n January 2017, Texas’ medical director for Medicaid warned his colleagues that the state was unprepared for a substantial increase in denials of in-home nursing. Dr. Rajendra Parikh estimated that the managed-care companies would double the rate of denials, emails show.</p>

<p>Parikh noted that for-profit companies were taking over care for about 60 percent of the new sick kids, and that “one of them” — a reference to Superior — “is consistently creating issues.” </p>

<p>In the program’s first three months, the health commission received more than 730 complaints from parents and health care providers — and the complaints would rise.</p>

<p>They were about children like Briar McCann, a 13-year-old quadriplegic with cerebral palsy in the San Antonio area who can’t speak and can’t eat or breathe on his own.</p>

    </div>

    <p>“You can tell that he’s crying or screaming,” says his mother, Gabriela McCann, “but nothing comes out.”</p>

<p>The first week of 2017, Superior cut the hours of his nurses, she says. And it refused to cover any physical therapy, records show, telling his mother that the boy, whose spine is curved so severely it looks like an “S,” could instead benefit from “home exercise.”</p>

<p>His mother decided to take Briar to Austin to talk with members of the House, though it would take two nurses, a gurney, a stretcher, a medical van and days of planning. </p>

<p>Over the next several months, scores of parents took their kids to the Capitol to show lawmakers who was being affected by the new managed-care program.</p>

<p>Week after week, Mehta drove from Flower Mound to talk with whoever would listen, one hand pushing Aiden in a stroller while the other pulled a rolling case of documents and pamphlets that outlined problems with managed care. For example, kids were losing speech therapy, one of her bullet points noted, which helps them learn not only to speak but also to eat without choking.</p>

<p>At the end of January, more than seven hours into public testimony, one physical therapist for disabled children <a href="http://tlcsenate.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=42&clip_id=11630">told Nelson’s Finance Committee</a> that “children are suffering.”</p>

<p>“One of our clients had his nursing hours cut even though the doctor was adamant that he needs 24-hour care,” said Ellen Osburn, owner of a therapy practice in Dallas.</p>

<p>She couldn’t name him, but she was referring to <a href="part1.html">D’ashon Morris</a>, a baby in Mesquite who had developed a dangerous habit of pulling out his tracheostomy tube, which kept his airway open. </p>

<p>“He pulled his trach,” Osburn told lawmakers, “and was found nonresponsive. He went from a just-about-to-walk toddler to a Level 2 coma because of cuts …”</p>

    <p>Before she could finish her sentence, a beep signaled that lawmakers had heard enough.</p>

<p>“Your time is up,” said Sen. Chuy Hinojosa, a McAllen Democrat who was running the hearing because Nelson had left.</p>

<p>As the legislative session dragged on, parents couldn’t understand why lawmakers weren’t doing anything.</p>

<p>In private, Mehta says, several legislators expressed concern and said they would intervene on an individual basis, but they wouldn’t dare introduce a bill about Medicaid — a dirty word in the Capitol.</p>

<p>“They’re all afraid of Jane Nelson,” Mehta says, referring to the veteran lawmaker.</p>

<p>Sen. Van Taylor, a Republican from Plano, intervened on behalf of 20 children who were denied nursing hours, equipment, drugs or need other help, according to his office. </p>

<p>“I’ve had multiple conversations with Van Taylor, face to face, where he says, ‘You come to me with your problems, and I’ll help you, just your family,’” Mehta says. “And I said, ‘What about all the other 168,000 kids?’ They don’t want to hear that.”</p>

<p>Taylor, running for Congress, will not return the Legislature in 2019. </p>

<p>“After meeting with these families my immediate priority was advocating on their behalf and pressing for better outcomes. Working together we fought the bureaucratic maze, demanded answers, and made some meaningful strides,” Taylor wrote in a statement. </p>

<p>“However, the stories highlighted in the Dallas Morning News investigative series, as well as other dealings that we have encountered in our office fighting alongside our constituents, are heartbreaking and unacceptable. Texas must do better.”</p>

<p>Over the last decade, Texas legislators, members of Congress and other officials have complained to the health commission more than 2,300 times about problems with managed-care companies. </p>

<p>Abbott and his office have lodged 38 complaints, eight of which were related to constituents being unable to access care. Nelson’s office has filed 64 complaints.</p>

<p>Lawmakers submitted more than a hundred just about the program for medically fragile children, the program that Mehta’s group was fighting, during its first year.</p>

    <p class="subhead">Disasters ignored, profits soared</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">A</span>s the legislative session was coming to a close in May of last year, Mehta and her son had made the long drive up and down Interstate 35 dozens of times but hadn’t yet gotten a bill to the floor.</p>

<p>There was a final prayer. Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, a Republican from Brenham, had agreed to attach to a larger bill an amendment that would require the state to study alternatives to lumping disabled children into managed care.</p>

<p>And Rep. Richard Raymond, a Laredo Democrat, was prepared to add an amendment that would allow parents to choose between managed care and staying in traditional Medicaid, where the state pays doctors with no middleman.</p>

<p>Both efforts failed.</p>

<p>Over and over, officials told inquiring lawmakers that they were monitoring the rollout of the STAR Kids program. They chalked up many of the complaints to parents overreacting because they had to switch doctors.</p>

<p>Mehta says that’s not so. “The more we dug into it, the more we learned about what was happening with other populations and what was happening with managed care in general,” she says. “And it’s a disaster.”</p>

<p>And financial results from the program’s first 10 months of operation raise questions.</p>

    <p>Health care corporations made record profits — averaging more than $1,000 per child. But nonprofit health care providers in the program spent more on medical care per child than the health care corporations did and sustained heavy losses, a Dallas Morning News analysis of financial data found. </p>

<p>The nonprofits — run by local hospitals and doctors — lost an average of $1,800 per child. Those organizations spent about 20 percent more of the taxpayer money they received on actual medical services than corporations that answer to Wall Street.</p>

<p>In many cases, nonprofits lost money in a part of the state where a for-profit insurer was able to make money. If the trends continue, the sick children in this new program will be far and away the most profitable patients for the companies like Superior and Amerigroup.</p>

<p>As lawmakers left Austin last June, Mehta wrote a Facebook post to the 1,500 members of Protect TX Fragile Kids:</p>

<p>“After this session, I don't think any of us are under any illusions,” she began. The Legislature “is not focused on what is right or good for the people of Texas.”</p>

<p>Despite the discouraging results last year, Mehta says she and other parents — and their fragile kids — will flood the Capitol again.</p>

<p>“The companies have gotten away with this for so long because the other populations they were serving before us couldn’t speak up,” she says. “They are lining their pockets at the expense of a very vulnerable population.”</p>
