    <p class="intro"><span class="sectioncap">R</span>esponding to a stern rebuke from Gov. Greg Abbott, the state health commission says it’s cracking down on medical companies that get billions of taxpayer dollars each year but shortchange sick and vulnerable Texans. </p>
    <p>As proof of its tough new attitude, the agency is fining the companies $11.7 million for failing to provide medical care for hundreds of elderly and disabled people in 2017.</p>
    <p>There’s just one problem: Regulators had originally recommended penalties of more than $102 million, sanctions that were quietly reduced by top health officials, <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> has learned.</p>

      <p>Managed-care companies overstate the number of physicians available to treat the state’s sickest patients. <a href="part3.html">Catch up.</a></p>
    </div>

    <p>The health-care companies left patients in horrifying conditions, says Nancy Toll, who headed the team of nurses who found the problems that sparked the fines. Medicaid managed-care organizations were leaving patients with dementia at home without any help, for instance, and not providing basic equipment like walkers and adult diapers.</p>
    <p>“Taxpayers are not getting their money’s worth on this,” Toll says, but health commission leaders “keep everything under wraps.”</p>
    <p>The Texas Health and Human Services Commission has routinely hidden the magnitude of managed-care companies’ failures, even as frontline regulators have recommended hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties, <em>The News</em> found. </p>
    <p>Based on thousands of pages of internal state records and interviews with current and former state workers, we found:</p>

    <ul class="content__list">
      <li>The state has reduced sanctions for managed-care companies by at least $395 million — and probably much more. Three current and former health commission employees independently confirmed that Medicaid directors wiped away hundreds of millions of dollars in sanctions before they could be recorded in official logs.</li>
      <li>Each time the state finds problems with a company, the firm is supposed to generate what’s called a “corrective action plan,” detailing steps it will take to shape up. But the health commission didn’t track those corrective measures to determine what, if anything, had improved; the agency compiled a decade’s worth of infractions only after <em>The News</em> asked, and the status of the fixes was not clear.</li>
      <li>The data the state uses to track how taxpayer money is spent comes from the companies and is often invalid or misleading. In 2015, regulators learned one company was <a href="document.html?number=4324233&title=Amerigroup-6.html#document/p4/a392716">double-counting</a> millions of dollars of expenses — but the company not only stayed in the Medicaid managed-care program but got billions in new business.</li>
      <li>The state has looked at tiny samples of the companies’ receipts but has still found that every year they misspend tens of millions of dollars on things like lobbying, entertainment, lawsuit settlements and payments to their corporate owners. Auditors urged the health commission to dig deeper, but it rarely followed up.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The officials who ran the state health commission and its managed-care programs communicated frequently with lobbyists for the health care companies, which are also major contributors to the campaigns of the governor and legislators, according to records obtained by <em>The News</em>. </p>
    <p>Staff members complained to us that the companies went directly to top state officials to get penalties reduced or removed.</p>

    <p class="subhead">A new ‘methodology’</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">I</span>n late 2017, as <em>The News</em> began asking the state about pervasive problems in Medicaid managed care, the state was making a major cutback to penalties stemming from serious lapses in care for disabled patients.</p>
    <p>First, regulators cut the original $102.2 million in penalties by more than half, to $40.6 million. An agency spokeswoman said the records we obtained about the original fines were “an initial draft from technical staff.”</p>
    <p>On Jan 11 of this year, the staff recommended $8.1 million in fines — 20 percent of the total at the time. Charles Smith, the longtime aide Abbott had appointed in 2016 to run the Health and Human Services Commission, didn’t want to do the 20 percent option and instead wanted 100 percent, but ordered the staff to “validate the methodology” first, <a href="document.html?number=4492757&title=Sanctions-Memo.html#document/p6/a427227">according to a memo</a>.</p>
    <p><p>The next week, Smith met with Abbott’s office to discuss the fines. And three days later, on a Saturday, Abbott sent a <a href="document.html?number=4425431&title=Gov-Greg-Abbott-STAR-PLUS-Response.html">a scathing letter</a>:</p>
    <p>“The details my staff relayed about the inadequate care by some of the managed care organizations (MCOs) is of great concern to me,” the governor wrote. Though in general managed care has been good for Texas, he wrote, the commission’s failure to protect the most vulnerable Texans is “particularly disturbing.”</p>
    <p>The letter turned heads in Austin. As governor, Abbott is ultimately in control of the commission, but his office rarely gets involved in such nitty-gritty details. And Smith was an Abbott favorite, having worked for him for a decade when he was attorney general. </p>
    <p>Abbott’s letter called for a new methodology for deciding what the state should fine problem companies. He also called for deciding if failures are “systemic.”</p>
    <p>Smith soon responded to Abbott’s rebuke, promising to establish a new methodology for penalties, to track systemic issues for which the companies should be fined, and to expand reviews of the programs that cover foster kids and medically fragile children.</p>

    <p class="cutline">Gov. Greg Abbott and Charles Smith, then head of the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, shook hands at a bill signing in May 2017. Abbott says he’s cracking down on health care companies that get billions in taxpayer dollars each year while shortchanging sick and vulnerable Texans. But state officials have quietly worked to lower penalties against the companies. (Robert T. Garrett/Staff)</p>
    </div>

    <p>The commission came up with a new total: $11.7 million -- despite the governor’s call for a crackdown. </p>
    <p>The commission used a new system for determining penalties, fining more for failures that caused “significant harm” and less for contract violations that didn’t hurt anyone, according to documents obtained by <em>The News</em>. The new methodology also weighted whether fines were related to systemic problems. </p>
    <p>The commissioner declined to speak with <em>The News</em> for months about our reporting on Medicaid managed care. But after we asked the governor’s office why the fines had been reduced even after Abbott had slammed health officials for poor oversight, Smith agreed to a phone call.</p>
    <p>In the last minutes of his final day at the commission — he retired Thursday — Smith told <em>The News</em> he had been responsible for the reductions. He had questioned the higher fines, he said, because they aren’t supposed to be punitive but rather just a way for the state to enforce its contracts. </p>
    <p>“We had a process that needed to be better vetted,” Smith said, adding, “I didn't have conversations with the governor's office about that amount.” </p>
    <p>Abbott’s office was adamant that it had urged the health commission to levy the maximum penalties.</p>
    <p>“The involvement by the Governor’s office was to condemn the Texas Health and Human Services’ Commission for failing to adequately hold accountable the Managed Care Organizations,” spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said in an emailed statement. </p>
    <p>During our phone call with Smith, we asked if he would comment on cases like that of D’ashon Morris, a baby who ended up in a persistent vegetative state because one company refused to <a href="part1.html">provide him the nursing care</a> his doctor ordered. </p>
    <p>Smith declined. </p>
    <p>State Rep. Sarah Davis, the Houston Republican who chairs the House General Investigating and Ethics Committee, has publicly criticized how the commission has been run on Abbott’s watch. </p>
    <p>The fine reductions and the correspondence between Abbott and Smith “struck me as suspicious,” Davis told <em>The News</em>.</p>
    <p>“We need to have an inquiry,” she said. “The reduction is so dramatic, and I don’t understand at this point who was the final decision maker, who was all involved in that process.”</p>

    <p><span class="sectioncap">T</span>hrough the Texas Public Information Act and other sources, <em>The News</em> obtained data and records detailing violations by managed-care companies from 2009 to 2017.</p>
    <p>Between fiscal years 2009 and 2016, four companies collectively got a pass on $12.6 million in fines: Superior Healthplan, Amerigroup, Cigna HealthSpring and Molina.</p>
    <p>But the official accounting often doesn’t tell the whole story. For instance, data provided by the commission’s media office shows that in 2012, the state fined those companies $5.2 million.</p>

    <p>Separate — and more detailed — internal records obtained by <em>The News</em> show rank-and-file staffers had recommended about $17.1 million for the third quarter of 2012 alone. They came up with that figure by counting up hundreds of violations, including improper denials of home care and prescriptions and repeated failures by companies to maintain an adequate network of doctors.</p>
    <p>The next year, auditors noted that Superior HealthPlan, which covers more Texans than any other Medicaid managed-care company, had been hit with $800,000 in sanctions in <a href="document.html?number=3762790&title=Superior-SFY-2013-Risk-Assessment-Final-Report.html#document/p15/a357604">December 2012</a>. But the commission’s accounting includes no record of that.</p>
    <p>Instead, the commission’s records show it sanctioned Superior only $51,750 for the 12-month period.</p>
    <p>When <em>The News</em> asked for records detailing how many times the state had suspended problem companies from enrolling new patients in Medicaid managed care, the agency said it would charge more than $1,800 to track down and produce the records.</p>
    <p>When we asked about a specific suspension, issued to Molina, the commission said there were no records. When we pressed further, a spokeswoman sent two separate <a href="document.html?number=4325793&title=Action-Memo-Molina-Enrollment-Suspension.html">suspension letters</a>, which showed Molina had been barred from enrolling new clients for about nine months in 2013. </p>
    <p>The company’s network of doctors and specialists had become woefully inadequate after it slashed what it paid for medical care in the Rio Grande Valley.</p>

    <p class="subhead">Problems with Amerigroup</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">S</span>enior health officials have often ignored the findings of their own auditors and contract watchdogs. </p>
    <p>For example, regulators found that Amerigroup — the second-biggest player in Medicaid managed care — had been submitting unreliable and misleading data to the state since at least 2015, according to internal records obtained by <em>The News</em>.</p>
    <p>The company was double-counting the services it provided, reporting at least $18 million in duplicate payments, the records show.</p>
    <p>Regulators said the flawed data created “a significant concern” about the overall integrity of what’s known as encounter data — actual payments for services provided to patients, according to a memo received by Smith months before he left the commission.</p>
    <p>“Any reporting from the agency that uses encounter data is potentially inaccurate,” they wrote, “including any reporting that may have been provided to the Texas Legislature” and the federal government, which pays more than half the costs of Medicaid.</p>
    <p>This data is fundamental to how Texas delivers health care to poor and disabled Texans. It’s used to determine what the state should pay companies each year. And lawmakers need it to budget for Medicaid — the state’s largest single expense. </p>
    <p>Inflated encounter data could result in the state paying more for the same services, or make it appear a company is providing more health care than it really is.</p>
    <p>The regulators recommended that the state suspend Amerigroup, which would have meant the company couldn’t take in new patients across much of Texas, records show.</p>
    <p>That would have sent shockwaves through the state. The health commission would have had to scramble to place sick children and disabled adults into a new program, forcing them to switch doctors and specialists. Dealing with that disruption could have cost the state millions of dollars.</p>
    <p>Months went by. Eventually, the audit problems just went away, staff members say. </p>
    <p>Olga Gallardo, a spokeswoman for Amerigroup, blamed computer glitches for the overbilling and unreliable data, problems she says the company has worked with the state Health and Human Services Commission to fix.</p>
    <p>“We take these matters very seriously,” she says. “Amerigroup has been very forthright with HHSC and the legislative community regarding our encounter problems.”</p>

    <p class="subhead">Millions misspent</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">T</span>exas is unusual in how it regulates managed-care companies. It pays billions first and asks questions later.</p>
    <p>The state asks the companies to account for where the money went in hundreds of spreadsheets, and outside auditors do a surface-level check on that accounting once a year. If companies report profit margins above 3 percent, they have to send some of that money back to the state.</p>
    <p>In 2013, auditors looked at just 65 of Amerigroup’s expenses and found that 16 had “<a href="document.html?number=3532304&title=Amerigroup-SFY-2013-334-Day-FSR-AUP-Report-FINAL.html#document/p14/a349608">no identifiable benefit to Texas Medicaid programs</a>,” including $650,000 in campaign contributions, legal-settlement payments and other inappropriate costs, according to documents <em>The News</em> obtained through the Texas Public Information Act.</p>
    <p>In 2015, an inspector general report noted that Amerigroup had spent more than a half million dollars in Medicaid money on investment management, lobbying and parties.</p>
    <p>Another deep dive, by the <a href="document.html?number=3468754&title=HealthSpring-Audit.html#document/p9/a352863">State Auditor’s Office, found</a> Cigna’s HealthSpring plan was using Medicaid money for $3.8 million in stock options for executives, charitable donations and gifts.</p>
    <p>Auditors questioned an additional $34 million the company spent on salaries and expenses that weren’t related to Texas Medicaid.</p>
    <p>By 2016, the health commission’s oversight was so sparse, disconnected and incomplete that the State Auditor’s Office concluded that the commission had <a href="document.html?number=3692791&title=SAO-Managed-Care.html#document/p2/a351884">no “overall strategy”</a> for monitoring the health plans.</p>

      {{img.jpg('toll-secondary', 'Nancy Toll stands next to a wall with her eyes closed as shadows fall across her.')}}
      <p class="cutline"> “Taxpayers are not getting their money’s worth on this,” says Nancy Toll, who led a state team of nurses that found widespread problems with taxpayer-funded managed care for the poor and vulnerable. But, she says, state health commission leaders “keep everything under wraps.”</p>
    </div>

  <section class="content-well">

    <p class="subhead">‘A glossover of the horror’</p>
    <p><span class="sectioncap">A</span>lso troubling were the results of studies that Nancy Toll and other state nurses did from 2015 to 2017.</p>
    <p>They focused on one portion of Medicaid managed care: the home- and community-based services waiver, which is supposed to help elderly and disabled people stay out of nursing homes. The state pays millions extra for companies to take care of those patients because they need special equipment and costly care like home nursing.</p>
    <p>In 2015, the nurses found that companies were collecting more money from the state but weren’t providing extra services to hundreds of patients, records show. </p>
    <p>After the nurses turned over all these violations to contract-compliance staffers, they calculated fines of at least $280 million, according to four current and former health commision employees.</p>
    <p>But those fines disappeared. </p>
    <p>Instead, records show, the Medicaid director in 2016, Gary Jessee, ordered “recoupments.” The state would demand a refund only for the patients whom staff members identified as not having received the higher level of care in their homes.</p>
    <p>In total, the state recouped $223,159.37, records show.</p>
    <p>Jessee told <em>The News</em> the commission didn’t levy huge fines because nurses had looked at only a small sample of patients. It was the first time the state had examined the issue, he says, and the commission hadn’t made it clear enough to the companies which patients should be upgraded to the more expensive program.</p>
    <p>“It really wasn’t a willy-nilly decision,” says Jessee, who left the commission last July to work for Sellers Dorsey, a consultant firm filled with former commission staff members who now advocate for managed-care expansion. “That was the very first time we had ever done that review.” </p>
    <p>But records show the state had found United Healthcare, then operating under the name Evercare, <a href="document.html?number=4195320&title=13010-RELEASABLE-Milwee-Letter-8-27-2012.html#document/p1/a387649"> behaving similarly years before</a>. United was suspended briefly for that in 2011, records show, and was audited and fined. </p>
    <p>Unlike fines, recoupments didn’t have to be reported to the public, allowing the companies to avoid scrutiny as they competed for Medicaid contracts here and in other states.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the state ordered the nursing team to do another study of the same program. </p>
    <p>Again, the team visited hundreds of patients in the same program and found the state was paying a higher premium for services that weren’t being delivered. Some patients had unmet needs so serious that the nurses recommended immediate intervention.</p>
    <p>“What I experienced, looking at these cases, was a level of hopelessness that was very hard for me to process,” says Toll, who left the program last year to work for a nonprofit health care provider. </p>
    <p>“As a nurse, and as a human being, I wanted so badly to be able to ensure that they received what we paid for, and that the taxpayers of Texas are seeing results for where their tax dollars are going.”</p>
    <p>The violations her team found were the ones that contract monitors said should cost $102.2 million, but that ultimately became $11.7 million in fines. </p>
    <p>Top officials push back on fines, Toll says, warning that some companies might stop doing business in Texas and the state would have no way to provide health care for millions of patients. </p>
    <p>Last November, when the health commission submitted its report to lawmakers about what state nurses had found, it shrouded its significance in vague and <a href="document.html?number=4477804&title=Utilization-Review-2017.html">bureaucratic language</a>, Toll says. </p>
    <p>“Everything is glossed over and distilled down into something that doesn’t accurately reflect what’s going on,” she says. “It’s a usual glossover of the horror.” </p>

    <p><em>CORRECTION, July 5, 2018: An earlier version of this article inaccurately described Amerigroup as “raking in” at least $18 million in overpayments. While auditors found the company double-counted millions of dollars in medical spending in its reports to the state, those duplicates did not directly result in extra payments to the company.</em></p>
