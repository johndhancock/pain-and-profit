    <p>As <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/" target="_blank">reported this year</a>, thousands of elderly and disabled Texans can’t get the medical care they need. Many chronically sick children have to fight for life-sustaining treatments. Countless <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part3.html" target="_blank">foster kids</a> can’t get doctors’ appointments.</p>

      <p>Texas patients lose in the state’s appeals system. <a href="part7.html">Catch up.</a></p>
    </div>


    <p>Under a program called Medicaid managed care, health care companies promise to save taxpayer money and to help patients by hiring care coordinators to connect them with doctors and treatments.</p>
    <p>But Texas cannot prove it is saving money, and the state’s own <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/document.html?number=3442477&title=GEER-Report#document/p150/a468796" target="_blank">analysts found</a> that most patients aren’t getting much — or any — care coordination.</p>
    <p>The good news is that Texas leaders can fix this mess. We interviewed more than a dozen experts, looked at what’s working in other states, and identified eight specific steps that could mend the state’s broken public health-care system and protect vulnerable Texans.</p>
    <p>Some require action from lawmakers, who convene in Austin in January. But most could be implemented by Gov. Greg Abbott’s administration now.</p>

    <div class="inline-block image-block">

      <p class="cutline">There are a number of potential fixes for Texas' managed-care problems that Gov. Greg Abbott could put into place without the need for legislators to take action. (Nick Wagner/Austin American-Statesman)</p>
    </div>
    <p>Abbott, who ultimately controls the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, has <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/texas-legislature/2018/06/15/response-pain-profit-series-abbott-says-texas-committed-health-care-not-profits-providers" target="_blank">defended managed care</a> and hasn’t publicly offered any clear solutions. Last month, <em>The News</em> <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/document.html?number=5348096&title=Abbott-No-Comment.html">provided Abbott’s office detailed explanations of the reforms</a> that experts recommend. But his spokesman, John Wittman, repeatedly declined to address our inquiries. </p>
    <p>State health officials, meanwhile, have taken some steps in response to our reporting. Those fixes include hiring 100 more regulators and nurses to ensure patients get the care they qualify for; changing the way the health commission monitors the networks of doctors that health-care companies advertise; and improving the way it handles appeals from patients who are denied doctor-ordered treatments.</p>
    <p>But if Abbott and lawmakers want to improve care and crack down on companies that fail, experts say they should consider more substantial reforms:</p>

    <ul class="content__list" id="step__list">
      <li>1. End the incentive to deny care</li>
      <li>2. Actually coordinate care</li>
      <li>3. Investigate, track and penalize bad behavior</li>
      <li>4. Make sure vulnerable people have access to doctors and treatments</li>
      <li>5. Fix the state’s unfair appeals system</li>
      <li>6. Give foster kids another option</li>
      <li>7. Take control of medical guidelines</li>
      <li>8. Let sick and disabled kids opt out</li>
    </ul>

            <h2>1. End the incentive to deny care</h2>
            <div class="step-content">

              <p><span class="sectioncap">M</span>anaged care spread to <a href="https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/total-medicaid-mco-enrollment/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D" target="_blank">almost 40</a> states in large part because lawmakers want a predictable way to budget for the rising cost of health care for poor, sick and disabled residents. </p>
              <p>Rather than paying doctors’ bills directly, as it used to do, Texas now writes a few giant checks to a handful of health care companies. These for-profit operations promise to save taxpayers money by negotiating reduced rates from doctors and nurses, cracking down on unnecessary treatments, and ensuring patients get preventive care.</p>
              <p>Texas officials say it’s impossible to tell if the state has saved money with managed care. Multiple national studies and reviews by officials in other states have also come up empty when looking for the cost savings that managed-care companies and their lobbying groups profess.</p>
              <p>Budget analysts in Iowa, for instance, found that <a href="https://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/health/2018/09/19/iowa-medicaid-cost-increases-nearly-triple-under-privatized-managed-care-legislature-kim-reynolds/1293372002/" target="_blank">per-patient costs nearly tripled</a> after it handed Medicaid to private companies. </p>
              <p>Texas pays these companies huge sums before any care is delivered, using a monthly per-patient fee. The companies in turn decide which treatments they’ll cover and which doctors they’ll pay. They take the risk that the overall cost of care won’t surpass their revenue.</p>
              <p>This system appears to work well for healthy people — immunizations and routine physicals occur more often, for example. But we found widespread problems when it came to patients who need intensive treatment and expensive medical equipment. </p>
              <p>This system also financially rewards companies when they withhold care Texans need, we found. With that cash in hand, companies can increase or maintain profits by skimping on care. Or they drive down payments to doctors, who simply stop accepting Medicaid, leaving thousands more patients struggling to get appointments. </p>
              <p>Experts say Texas lawmakers should consider what state legislators did in Connecticut, which experienced the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/connecticut-moves-away-from-private-insurers-to-administer-medicaid-program-1458325696" target="_blank">same problems</a> now plaguing Texas. Lawmakers concluded that putting millions in company coffers first, and hoping they use it to deliver proper care, wasn’t working for patients and wasn’t saving the state money.</p>
              <p>So, in 2012, that state’s legislature took back the financial risk and responsibility of caring for Medicaid patients. Connecticut now pays doctors and hospitals directly, which means corporate bottom lines aren’t affected by the amount of health care patients need.</p>
              <p>The state’s lawmakers didn’t abandon managed care altogether. They kept paying nonprofits and companies a flat rate, but only to coordinate patients’ medical care and handle administrative tasks.</p>
              <p>“It’s been an improvement for everybody in Connecticut in terms of the patients that we represent, the providers and the state paying the bills,” says Sheldon Toubman, a disability lawyer at the New Haven Legal Assistance Association.</p>
              <p>Now, for-profit companies in Connecticut “don’t have their thumb on the scale for whether this kid gets surgery or not because it doesn’t come out of their bottom line,” he adds. “It comes out of the state’s bottom line.”</p>
              <p>Connecticut’s health agency <a href="https://www.cga.ct.gov/med/council/2018/0914/20180914ATTACH_MAPOC%2010%20Things%20to%20Know%20About%20Connecticut%20Medicaid.pdf" target="_blank">reported</a> that it now spends less per patient on medical care and far less on overhead costs — about 3 percent vs. the almost 13 percent Texas pays. And more doctors are willing to see Medicaid patients.</p>
              <p><strong><em>This requires legislative change.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>2. Actually coordinate care</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">A</span> <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/document.html?number=3442477&title=GEER-Report" target="_blank">report last year</a> by Texas’ nonpartisan Legislative Budget Board found that “most members in managed-care programs receive minimal or no coordination services from their managed care organization.”</p>
              <p>That is contrary to the entire idea of managed care.</p>
              <p>Last year, medical-school researchers looked at national data on children in managed care to see if their needs were being met with the help of a care coordinator. <a href="http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/pediatrics/140/3/e20163820.full.pdf" target="_blank">They found</a> that paying family doctors, instead of managed-care companies, to coordinate medical treatments led to clear improvements.</p>
              <p>National experts say Texas should hold managed care companies accountable for providing care coordination, and wrest control from them if they fail. That could mean paying local doctors or nonprofits instead.</p>
              <p>Minnesota, for example, will soon allow patients to work directly with a local health clinic instead of a massive corporation. New Mexico trains local public health departments to coordinate patient care.</p>
              <p><strong><em>Abbott’s administration has flexibility to tailor its contracts and, with approval from the federal government, try new models for care coordination.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>3. Investigate, track and penalize bad behavior</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">F</span>or years, top Texas health officials have quietly reduced <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part4.html" target="blank">hundreds of millions of dollars in fines</a> against companies that violated the terms of their contracts.</p>
              <p>Last year, under Abbott’s watch, at least $90 million in fines disappeared. In his last act as health commissioner, Charles Smith, a longtime Abbott aide, said he reduced those fines because the agency needed a better system for adding up penalties.</p>
              <p>Rep. Sarah Davis, a Houston-area Republican leading the House investigation prompted by our series, told <em>The News</em> those reductions were “suspicious.” Managed-care organizations, or MCOs, that fail should be fined, and that process should be more transparent, she says. </p>
              <p>Financial penalties are “really the only thing we have to hold these MCOs accountable,” Davis says, “and if you disregard them, you're going to see what we have here, which is a really clear pattern of denying services to needy populations.”</p>
              <p>She and <a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/investigations/2018/06/07/lawmakers-call-change-after-pain-profit-series-abbott-silent#_ga=2.97674719.1709670055.1543849265-311783799.1476299258" target="_blank">Rep. Richard Raymond</a>, the Laredo Democrat who leads the House Human Services committee, said they may want to refocus the health commission’s vast investigative department. </p>
              <p>Lawmakers designed the Office of Inspector General to uncover and penalize doctors who commit fraud. But that system is antiquated, critics say, because about 92 percent of Medicaid patients are under the care of companies that — <a href="https://compliance.com/special-investigative-unit-services-support-and-outsourcing" target="_blank">by law</a> — are supposed to investigate fraudulent bills from doctors themselves. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Abbott’s administration can enforce the contracts, improve oversight and increase transparency without any legislative action. Lawmakers can redesign the Office of Inspector General to investigate problems with managed-care organizations.</em></strong></p>

            <h2>4. Make sure vulnerable people have access to doctors and treatments</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">P</span>atients across Texas are having trouble getting appointments with doctors and specialists. That’s because some companies have been vastly overstating the number of doctors and specialists available to treat them. Texas officials have known about this crisis but repeatedly given the companies a pass.</p>
              <p><a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part3.html" target="_blank">After <em>The News</em> exposed huge gaps in the networks</a>, the state’s Medicaid director promised stricter enforcement and better oversight. </p>
              <p>But experts say to truly fix the problem, lawmakers need to make Medicaid more attractive to good doctors. </p>
              <p>A recent national study commissioned by The Physicians Foundation found that 30 percent of Texas doctors don’t accept Medicaid patients, almost twice the national average. Surveys by various groups have blamed low pay for doctors and onerous paperwork required by managed-care companies. </p>
              <p>Experts say lawmakers should force companies to reduce red tape and to pay doctors competitively. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Abbott’s administration can crack down on inadequate networks and penalize failing companies without legislative reforms. Lawmakers could pursue broader reforms, such as increasing funding and rates for Medicaid providers, or follow the lead of some states that set minimums for what managed-care companies pay doctors.</em></strong></p>
              <h5 class="next-step" data-step="5">Next step: Fix the state’s unfair appeals system <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></h5>

            <h2>5. Fix the state’s unfair appeals system</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">W</span>hen health care companies refuse to cover doctor-ordered medical treatments, patients are supposed to be able to fight back through a so-called fair hearing. But <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part7.html" target="_blank"><em>The News</em> found that this process heavily favors companies</a>, which prevail more than two-thirds of the time.</p>
              <p>To fix this, the state should “completely start over,” says Peter Hofer, a disability lawyer in Austin. The notice patients get when a company refuses to cover care “doesn’t tell you anything,” he says. “It’s supposed to give you specific reasons that pertain to your individual medical condition.”</p>
              <p>The texts of hearing decisions, which Texas effectively keeps secret, should be made available online so patients can invoke prior rulings that might help them, Hofer says. A spokeswoman said that the commission is working to make the decisions public but that it would take “considerable time.”</p>
              <p>In New York, patients can search nearly a decade of hearing decisions online. In Delaware, state nurses examine each patient appeal. In Tennessee, the state health agency assesses appeals that companies uphold.</p>
              <p>Some states allow patients to ask <a href="https://hhs.texas.gov/sites/default/files/documents/services/health/medicaid-chip/provider-information/mco-resoruces/2017/CFR-Part-438.pdf" target="_blank">independent medical professionals to review</a>, and perhaps overturn, company denials. Texas declined to create such a program, despite encouragement from the federal government.</p>
              <p><strong><em>All of these reforms could be enacted by Abbott’s administration.</em></strong> </p>

          <div class="step">
            <h2>6. Give foster kids another option</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">T</span>exas should reconsider its contract with the single company charged with providing health care for 30,000 foster children, more than half of whom have special needs, advocates say. For more than a decade, Superior HealthPlan has been the sole Medicaid company available to foster kids, a state-sanctioned arrangement that critics say gives the company no market incentive to provide quality care. </p>
              <p>Tara Grigg Garlinghouse, co-founder of the Foster Care Advocacy Center in Houston, says Superior would be forced to improve its services to foster children if other companies could compete for those patients.</p>
              <p>“They get X amount of dollars for X amount of kids, regardless of what services they provide,” says Grigg Garlinghouse, a lawyer who represents disabled foster children.</p>
              <p>Pervasive problems with Superior’s health care management are worsening the state’s already troubled child-welfare system, <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part6.html" target="_blank"><em>The News’</em> investigation found</a>. </p>
              <p>Michael Cation, a Superior spokesman, said that the company has received high marks for making sure foster children receive routine doctor visits and that the number of complaints it receives are small compared with the services it provides.</p>
              <p>“STAR Health is helping to improve the lives of Texas foster children,” he <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/document.html?number=5348099&title=Superior-Reforms-Response.html" target="_blank">said in a lengthy statement</a>. “The percentage of STAR Health members between the ages of 3 to 6 years who have had one or more well child visits with a primary care physician in a given year has consistently been above the 90th percentile when compared with all other Medicaid plans nationally.</p>
              <p>“We remain committed to continuing to provide quality, continuous care to one of Texas’ most vulnerable populations,” he added.</p>
              <p>Judges in Houston have stepped in to order medical care that Superior has denied to foster kids, <em>The News</em> found. And families who have taken in medically needy children are backing out, adding to the state’s drastic shortage of beds.</p>
              <p><a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part1.html" target="_blank">D’ashon Morris</a>, a foster baby in Mesquite, suffered a catastrophic brain injury after the company refused to provide the home nursing his foster mother, nurses and doctor said he needed, state records show. In August, despite those failures, Abbott’s administration gave Superior a three-year extension on its exclusive $350 million-a-year contract. </p>
              <p><strong><em>Abbott’s administration can explore canceling its contract with Superior or allowing competitors to bid when it lapses in 2021. Lawmakers could require that foster parents have a choice between at least two companies, a requirement in other Medicaid programs.</em></strong></p>
              <h5 class="next-step" data-step="7">Next step: Take back control of medical guidelines <i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></h5>

          <div class="step">
            <h2>7. Take control of medical guidelines</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">D’</span>ashon Morris’ home nursing was initially denied as part of <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part1.html" target="_blank">a broader cost-savings strategy</a>, internal state memos show; without state approval, the company tweaked its own policy to make it easier to deny one-on-one nursing for sick foster kids. Records obtained by <em>The News</em> show state nurses determined that this policy violated the state’s contract and state and federal law — only after the damage had been done.</p>
              <p>While the state sets broad guidelines on what care should be covered, 20 different companies have 20 different sets of interpretations and rules that doctors, patients and state appeals officers struggle to navigate.</p>
              <p>Texas should throw this system out the window, and create one definitive and clear set of rules that everyone must follow, says Sarah Somers, a lead attorney with the National Health Law Program. “It would be a big step in the right direction,” she says. </p>
              <p>The Texas health commission also needs to listen to medical professionals, whose opinions are supposed to receive substantial deference, says Maureen O’Connell of the Southern Disability Law Center. But state officials do the opposite, she says.</p>
              <p>“It leads to very inconsistent decision-making,” she says. “And in the end it’s just arbitrary; it’s unfair.” </p>
              <p><strong><em>Abbott’s administration can consolidate medical necessity guidelines and provide more oversight of medical decisions without legislative action. Abbott and lawmakers also could work together to create and fund a consumer protection office that can swiftly advocate for patients who are denied care.</em></strong></p>

          <div class="step">
            <h2>8. Let sick and disabled kids opt out</h2>
            <div class="step-content">
              <p><span class="sectioncap">I</span>n 2015, Texas lawmakers voted to push about 160,000 extremely sick and disabled children into managed care.</p>
              <p>The next year, an advisory board warned the health commission that the system couldn’t handle these kids. The state’s tool for grading what care they needed hadn’t been properly tested. Parents were already having problems with the companies.</p>
              <p>But the commission <a href="https://interactives.dallasnews.com/2018/pain-and-profit/part5.html" target="_blank">rushed forward with STAR Kids anyway</a>. Complaints, appeals and interventions from concerned lawmakers immediately surged.</p>
              <p><em>The News</em> analyzed financial data from STAR Kids’ first year and found that for-profit companies made about $1,000 per child while nonprofit managed-care organizations, which spent more on actual health care, lost $1,800 per child. </p>
              <p>That case study shows the state should consider letting these families opt out of managed care, says Anne Dunkelberg, a health care policy analyst with the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities.</p>
              <p>“We have to question whether there’s room for profit, whether it’s really allowable to trade away some of the care those kids need — for a profit,” she says. </p>
              <p><a href="https://nashp.org/state-medicaid-managed-care-program-design-for-children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs/" target="_blank">As of last year</a>, 20 states either exempt children with high medical needs from managed care or allow families to opt out if they would rather have traditional Medicaid.</p>
