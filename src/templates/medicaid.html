        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Medicaid is the government program that pays for medical care for poor and disabled people in Texas, everything from routine checkups to heart surgery.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid_One_in_7">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>In Texas, it covers more than 4.5 million people ‒ 1 out of every 7 residents.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid_ani_numbers">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Most of the people we’re talking about are poor kids, with incomes under $22,000 a year for a family of two. Others are elderly and disabled people. Some of them are children so sick that their families can’t pay all the costs of their care. And all foster kids are covered by Medicaid.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid_ani_pct">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>The federal government covers almost 58 percent of the cost of Medicaid, or about $23 billion. The state pays about $17 billion.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid5">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Traditionally, state workers supervised Medicaid, paying doctors and nurses and medical equipment companies.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid6">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>But the cost of that system started climbing, driven by inflation and the growing cost of health care.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid7">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>And critics complained about fraud, as well as about emergency rooms crammed with poor people who didn’t have doctors.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid8">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Enter “managed care.” Like the private sector’s HMOs ‒ health maintenance organizations ‒ managed-care companies promise to cut costs by, for example, negotiating lower prices with doctors and hospitals.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid9">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>They also promise to improve the health care of the patients they cover, emphasizing preventive care like vaccinations and hiring experts to help hook people up with the services they need.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid10">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Today, almost all of the people on Medicaid in Texas are in managed care. Most of them are cared for by for-profit companies, which the state pays $17 billion a year. Profits are supposed to be limited by the state.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid11">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Managed care seems to be helping basically healthy people ‒ little kids are getting vaccinations and older people are staying out of the hospital.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid12">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>But <em>The Dallas Morning News</em> has found that this system is failing the most vulnerable Texans: The disabled, very sick children, foster kids. They aren’t getting nursing care, or medical equipment like wheelchairs. They can’t find doctors or specialists. And there aren’t nearly enough “care coordinators” to help them.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="pp__slide" data-image="medicaid13">
        <div class="pp__slide-content">
          <p>Some experts say the only way the for-profit managed care companies can profit off these people is to cut back on their medical treatment. The consequences can be lethal.</p>
